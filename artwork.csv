Saint Nicholas of Tolentino, canonized in 1446, appears on the far right wearing the Augustinian habit. The altarpiece would have been completed with five pinnacles showing the evangelists and Christ, a base (predella) showing the history of Saint John the Baptist, and pilasters with small figures of saints. The highly stylized figures and gold background mimic an older artistic approach, indicating Giovanni’s preference for the work of his great fourteenth-century forebears."
